# QR-Code Generator

A simple QR code generator developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This lightweight tool enables users to quickly and easily create QR codes for any type of content, including URLs, plain text and contact information. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to create a QR code: simply enter the desired text or link into the input field and the QR code will be instantly created and displayed. In the background, the generator uses a JavaScript library to render the QR code as an image or canvas element. Once generated, the QR code can be downloaded or scanned directly, making it useful for sharing information, promoting websites or creating scannable tags for print materials.
